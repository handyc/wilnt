# wilnt
esoteric language focused on minimal functions and loops

## everything below this line is a draft

# similar to ifnot() but with time and iteration

```
wilnt()
{

while(not finished)
{
wilnt()
}
base return ifnot()

}
```

# examples

```
let A = "I like cheese."
let B = "It is raining"
let t = 10
let i = 100
let c = wilnt(wilnt(wilnt(A, B, t, i), wilnt(A, B, t, i), t, i), wilnt(A, B, t, i), t, i)
```
